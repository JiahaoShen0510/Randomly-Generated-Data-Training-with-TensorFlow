Train the randomly generated dataset with the Tensorflow that the inputs are between -10 to 10, and has total 10,000 observations.
Apply the method of Stochastic Gradient Descent and use both L1 & L2 approaches. 

The targeted weights are [634, -897], and the bias is -13

From L2 approach, achieve the weights of [634.0195, -897.0119], and the bias of -13.003721

From L1 approach, achieve the weights of [633.9818, -897.00354], and the bias of -13.017602
